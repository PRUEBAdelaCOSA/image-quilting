# image-quilting
A C++ project implementing the Image Quilting algorithm based on Efros and Freeman's method for seamless texture synthesis. It generates larger, continuous textures by stitching overlapping patches from a source image. Using Minimum Error Boundary Cut and MSE Patch Selection, it minimizes visible seams and achieves high-quality texture results.
